## Otter facts

Otters are semi-aquatic mammals that are known for their playful behavior and sleek, streamlined bodies that are
perfectly adapted for swimming. They belong to the family Mustelidae, which also includes weasels, ferrets, and badgers.

Otters have webbed feet, thick fur, and long, powerful tails that help them swim and dive underwater. They are
carnivorous and primarily feed on fish, but they also eat crustaceans, mollusks, and small mammals.

There are 13 different species of otters, including the sea otter, river otter, and giant otter. Otters can be found in
a variety of habitats, from coastal waters to freshwater rivers and lakes.

Unfortunately, many species of otters are threatened by habitat loss, pollution, and hunting. Conservation efforts are
underway to protect these charismatic animals and their habitats.
