# Exercise 5

## What i did

### Why are logging libraries used?

- Logging libraries are used to record information about the execution process of an application.
- They enable systematic logging of events, errors, and status information, allowing for better understanding of the application's behavior and identification of issues.

### What log levels are available in Log4j and what do they mean?

- Log4j supports various log levels, such as TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL.
- Each log level has a specific priority and indicates the level of detail in the logged messages. Developers can choose the appropriate log level to achieve the desired level of detail in the logs, such as detailed debugging information or only important events.

### What configuration options does Log4j provide?

- Log4j offers numerous configuration options to customize logging behavior.
- Developers can configure the output target (e.g., file, console), set the desired log level for specific classes or packages, define the layout of logged messages, and specify roll-over strategies for log files. This allows for fine-tuning the logging configuration to suit the project's requirements.
